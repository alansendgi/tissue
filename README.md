# tissue

tissue visualizes activity on networks in real-time on a high level of abstraction. Unlike tools like [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/) or [tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/) that show information about individual packets going over the network, tissue aggregates network data and presents higher level information about what's happening on a network.
