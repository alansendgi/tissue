If you want to contribute to tissue, please follow the following steps:

* File a ticket against the tissue project describing the contribution you want to make
* Wait for us to give feedback. Maybe we are already working on what you asked for or maybe we do not want the feature you planned to contribute in tissue. Don't waste your time doing unnecessary work!
* If we greenlight your request, please fork tissue, work on your code and send us a pull request through GitHub when you're done. If you are planning to make big changes, please send us multiple pull requests that are useful independently.
* If we block your request, please fork tissue and start working on your fork. We still appreciate pull requests from your fork down the line.
* Please make sure that you are familiar with the information posted on the [Developer Information page](https://github.com/econchick/tissue/wiki/Developer-Information) on the tissue wiki.

### Bugs and feature requests

If you want to file a bug against or request a feature for tissue, please
use our [project bug tracker](https://github.com/econchick/tissue/issues). We
will then triage your ticket and let you know about the next steps we are
planning to take.


#### Code style guide

As with any project, please try to emulate the existing code style. If you feel that we're doing it wrong, please file a ticket in our issue tracker. For tissue, the indentation question has been solved. We use four spaces for indentation regardless of the language the code is written in.
