Installation
============

.. _install:

via Pip
-------

tissue can be easily installed using::

	$ pip install tissue

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, tissue can only be run on systems that have `tcpdump <http://www.tcpdump.org/>`_ and related dependencies installed.  Presumably, all \*nix-like systems should have this available.  Otherwise, you may install the `latest release <http://www.tcpdump.org/#latest-release>`_.

Windows
^^^^^^^

There is `Windows PCAP <http://www.tcpdump.org/wpcap.html>`_ for folks with Windows distribution, but this application has not been tested with it nor developed with it in mind (sorry!).
